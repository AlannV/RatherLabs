When I started this challenge I didn't have a real understanding about blockchains, dapps, smart contracts, etc. 
I had a vague idea of what they were, but I didn't know how they really worked.
So, I have been reading and seeing a lot of videos about this topic and I have been trying to understand how they work.
I will leave down here the links of the videos I have seen and the reading material I have used to understand it better
